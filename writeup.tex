\section{Phase 1}
\paragraph{Answer}
swordfish

\paragraph{Discovery}
I ran strings on bomb and found the string swordfish by a bunch of other strings that outputed to the screen. So I typed it in and it worked.

\paragraph{Thoughts}
I am happy that phase 1 was easy to solve. I hope the rest of the phases are just as easy.
